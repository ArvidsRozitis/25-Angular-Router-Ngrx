      title: "Chorizo & mozzarella gnocchi bake",
      ingredients: [
        "1 tbsp olive oil",
        "1 onion, finely chopped",
        "2 garlic cloves, crushed",
        "120g chorizo, diced",
        "2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes",
        "1 tsp caster sugar",
        "600g fresh gnocchi",
        "125g mozzarella ball, cut into chunks",
        "small bunch of basil, torn",
        "green salad, to serve",
      ],
      steps: [
        "Heat the oil in a medium pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion and garlic for 8-10 mins until soft. Add the chorizo and fry for 5 mins more. Tip in the tomatoes and sugar, and season. Bring to a simmer, then add the gnocchi and cook for 8 mins, stirring often, until soft. Heat the grill to high.",
        "Stir ¾ of the mozzarella and most of the basil through the gnocchi. Divide the mixture between six ovenproof ramekins, or put in one baking dish. Top with the remaining mozzarella, then grill for 3 mins, or until the cheese is melted and golden. Season, scatter over the remaining basil and serve with green salad.",

      title: "Air fryer roast dinner",
      ingredients: [
        "2-3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters",
        "3 tsp vegetable, olive or rapeseed oil",
        "1 large or 2 small chicken breasts, skin-on",
        "3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into batons",
        "100g frozen peas",
        "gravy, to serve",
      ],
      steps: [
        "Soak the potatoes in water for 30 mins, then drain and rinse. Heat the air fryer for 2 mins. Dry the potatoes thoroughly, then put in a bowl, drizzle over 1 tsp of the oil and season with salt and pepper. Using your hands or a spoon, coat the potatoes in the oil, then put into the air fryer basket, in one layer if possible. Cook for 10 mins at 190C.",
        "Meanwhile, coat the chicken in another 1 tsp oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Once the potatoes have been in for 10 mins, move them to the sides and lay the chicken in the centre of the basket. Cook for 10 mins.",
        "Coat the carrots in the remaining oil. After the chicken has cooked for 10 mins, remove it from the basket and add the carrots, mixed in with the potatoes, then move both to the sides and put the chicken back into the centre. Cook for 10-15 mins, still at 190C. At this point, the chicken should be cooked – check by inserting a knife into the thickest part and checking the juices run clear. Alternatively, a meat thermometer should read 70C. If it’s not quite done, cook for a further 5 mins. Remove the chicken and rest it under a piece of tented foil.",
        "Put the peas in a small ovenproof dish or mug with 2 tbsp water and cover with foil to prevent any moisture escaping. Put in the air fryer basket where the chicken was and cook for a final 10 mins at 190C. The potatoes should be golden and crisp, the carrots tender and the peas warmed through. Slice the chicken breast and serve with the vegetables and gravy.",
