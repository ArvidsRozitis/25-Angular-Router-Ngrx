# 25 Angular Router and NGRX

   In this app, I'm testing Angular router and router in children. I'm also using a global state manager for Angular called Ngrx.
If you're interested in checking out the app yourself, you can download this repository,
open it in your code editor, and then use the commands `cd .\recipes-app\`, `npm install`, and `ng serve --open`.
